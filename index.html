           Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s
           perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about
           your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing
           as an issue.
         </p>
     
         <p>
           Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if
           the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t
           transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
           changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see
           at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our reality
           changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
           way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
         </p>

           They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
           person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from
           clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
           person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that
           : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do
           it anyway.

         <p>
           Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
           evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We
           are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
           The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q> The next day the
           horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
           everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
           events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is
           it bad? I don't know.</q>
         </p>
     
         <p>
           The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
           riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh
           dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I
           don't know.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to
           conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
           broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that
           great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q>
         </p>

              The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
              complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
              happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
              consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
              consequences of good fortune.

           Conclusion <em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for
           monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal
           out of it...
